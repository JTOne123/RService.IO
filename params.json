  "body": "### Welcome!\r\n`RService.IO` is one of the first web service frameworks for ASP.Net Core!  It was based on concepts from `NService`, better known as `ServiceStackv3`, but with a bit of a twist.  The goal is to provide a fast minimal web service framework that is best for anything from micro-services to full on APIs.\r\n\r\n### Using RService.IO\r\nTo use `RService.IO` simply create a new ASP.Net Core project.  In the `Startup.cs` file add the following code:  \r\n```csharp\r\npublic void ConfigureService(IServiceCollection service)\r\n{\r\n  services.AddRServiceIo(opts => \r\n  {\r\n    opts.AddServiceAssembly(typeof(FancyNewService));\r\n    opts.EnableDebugging = true; // This is optional but will display the developer exception page\r\n  });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n```csharp\r\npublic void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env, ILoggerFactory loggerFactory)\r\n{\r\n  app.UseRServiceIo();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen just create a service that implements `IService`.  On a side note, currently `void` methods are not allowed for service endpoints.\r\n\r\n### Contributing\r\nPlease feel free to contribute to this project.
